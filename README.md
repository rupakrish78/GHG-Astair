A report on the Green House Gas Effect from Supply Chain

The source of my data is from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) website. My dataset is related to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission related to supply chain. The key attributes of my data are the supply chain emission factors for each category classified by the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System).
 
Environmental impacts from supply chains include water pollution, toxic waste, deforestation, air emission and greenhouse gas emission. According to US EPA, supply chains account for more than 90% of the GHG emissions. Because supply chains consume resources in large quantities, they cause a lot of carbon emissions. My objective is to find which supply chain emits most carbon equivalents per kilogram of material and how it is impacting the environment. This will help figure out a good sustainability approach for those products to help reduce the emissions.
